## Description

### Stream Compation
![](img/streamCompaction.png)

The goal of stream compaction is that, given an array of elements, we create a new array with elements that meet a certain criteria, e.g. non null and preserve order. It's used in path tracing, collision detection, sparse matrix compression, etc.

* Step 1:  Compute temporary array
* Step 2:  Run exclusive scan on temporary array
* Step 3:  Scatter

### CPU Scan

### Naive GPU Scan

### Work-Efficient GPU Scan

### Thrust's Implementation


## Performance Analysis

* Roughly optimize the block sizes of each of your implementations for minimal run time on your GPU.
Array Size 1<<15 


| Block Size    | 128           |  256     | 512     |1024    |
| ------------- |-------------|-------| -----|----- |
| naive         | 0.16784       | 0.132096 | 0.157504|0.155584 |
| coherent      | 1639.7        |   1534.2 | 0.094048| 0.096736 |


* Compare all of these GPU Scan implementations (Naive, Work-Efficient, and Thrust) to the serial CPU version of Scan. Plot a graph of the comparison (with array size on the independent axis).

* Write a brief explanation of the phenomena you see here.
